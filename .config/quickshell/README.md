# Quickshell

## Tasks

- [ ] Cache Matugen's schemes that were compiled before and use them.
- [ ] Rebuild the prayers logic yourself and preferable extract it from a
      database to work offline.
- [ ] Learn animations and implement some bubbly clipping ones.
- [ ] Create on-startup animation.
- [ ] Improve the ActiveWorkspace to include items.
- [ ] Create a power menu on the far left when clicking on Arch's menu.
- [ ] Create a tray menu (that's hidden tho)
- [ ] Make the battery's rectangle's color change to red the lower it gets
      (starts changing colors below 20-15%).
- [ ] Create an OSD and make it show the thing that's being played right now.
- [ ] Create your daily main mandatory habits when you hover on the quote. These
      are mandatory, whatever your day is like, you have to do them, unless
      they'll be harmful (like exercising before sleep), but this is the only
      harmful thing I can think about, so don't create fake reasons.
